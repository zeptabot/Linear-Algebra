## Prompt:
lets say I'm already given m-3 lienar indepdenr tvectors am i allowed to claim that I can add 3 vectros and still linear indeoendent like I could alwayd find aset even given some predetermined vectors?

## Response:
Yes, you absolutely can. This is guaranteed by a fundamental result in linear algebra.

Given a list of linearly independent vectors in a finite-dimensional vector space, you can always add more vectors to it until you have a basis for the entire space, and the list will remain linearly independent throughout the process.

### The Theorem

This is formally stated in _Linear Algebra Done Right_ as **Theorem 2.32: Every linearly independent list extends to a basis**.

> Every linearly independent list of vectors in a finite-dimensional vector space can be extended to a basis of the vector space.

The MAT223 notes present a similar result in

**Chapter Exercise P3.9**, which states that any basis for a subspace can be extended to a basis for the entire space.

### How it Works

The process relies on the proof we discussed previously:

1.  **Start with your list** of `m-3` linearly independent vectors. Let's call its span `U`.
2.  Since `dim(U) = m-3` and the whole space has dimension `m`, `U` is not the whole space. Therefore, there must be a vector `w₁` that is **not** in `U`.
3.  As we established, adding `w₁` to your list creates a new, larger list of `m-2` vectors that is still **linearly independent**.
4.  You can repeat this process. The span of your new list of `m-2` vectors still doesn't cover the whole space, so you can find another vector `w₂` not in its span and add it. The resulting list of `m-1` vectors is still linearly independent.
5.  Repeating one last time gives you a linearly independent list of `m` vectors, which forms a basis for your `m`\-dimensional space.

## Prompt:
Since dim(U) = m-3 and the whole space has dimension m, there must be a vector w₁ that is not in U. where does this come from and how doyou justify it

## Response:
Of course. That's a crucial step, and its justification comes from a key theorem relating a subspace's dimension to the dimension of the entire space.

The justification is a two-step logical process:

1.  If a subspace has a strictly smaller dimension than the whole space, it cannot be equal to the whole space.
2.  If the subspace is not equal to the whole space, then by definition, there must be at least one vector in the whole space that is not in the subspace.

* * *

### The Theorem

The formal justification for step 1 comes from

**Theorem 2.39** in _Linear Algebra Done Right_, which is titled "subspace of full dimension equals the whole space". It states:

> Suppose that V is finite-dimensional and U is a subspace of V such that `dim(U) = dim(V)`. Then `U = V`.

The statement you need is the **contrapositive** of this theorem. The contrapositive of "If P, then Q" is "If not Q, then not P". Both statements are logically equivalent.

The contrapositive of Theorem 2.39 is:

> If `U ≠ V`, then `dim(U) ≠ dim(V)`.

Since we also know that

`dim(U) ≤ dim(V)` for any subspace `U`, we can conclude:

> **If `dim(U) < dim(V)`, then `U` cannot be equal to `V`**.

### Applying it to Your Case

1.  You have a subspace `U` where `dim(U) = m-3`.
2.  The whole space `V` has `dim(V) = m`.
3.  Since `m-3 < m`, you have `dim(U) < dim(V)`.
4.  Based on the theorem above, because the dimension of `U` is strictly less than the dimension of `V`, it is impossible for `U` and `V` to be the same set (`U ≠ V`).
5.  By the very definition of set inequality, if `U` is a proper subset of `V`, there must exist at least one element `w₁` that is in `V` but is not in `U`.

## Prompt:
any subspace has a basis. can i cite this theorem directly based off MAT223 ONLY? do i need to prove it? is it already proved im thenxctbook or explicitly stated?

## Response:
Yes, you can directly claim this based on the theorems in the MAT223 textbook, but it requires combining two results. The statement "every subspace has a basis" is not presented as a single, standalone theorem, but it is proven constructively through the combination of **Theorem 3.4** and **Theorem 3.11**.

Here is the two-step justification you can cite directly from the MAT223 notes:

1.  **Every subspace has a finite spanning set.** **Theorem 3.4** states that a subset `V` is a vector subspace of Rⁿ if and only if there exists a list of vectors `{v₁, ..., vₘ}` such that `V = Span(v₁, ..., vₘ)`.
2.  **Every finite spanning set can be reduced to a basis.** **Theorem 3.11** ("Finding Bases") provides a concrete algorithm (the pivot column method) to take any spanning set, such as the one guaranteed by Theorem 3.4, and find a subset of those vectors that forms a basis for the subspace .

Therefore, since every subspace has a spanning set (by Theorem 3.4), and every spanning set can be reduced to a basis (by the method of Theorem 3.11), it follows that every subspace has a basis. You do not need to re-prove this; you can cite this chain of logic from the textbook.

## Prompt:
"assume we have a vector ⃗w ∈ R

n that is not in the

span of the vectors in A. Then the set A′ = {⃗v1, . . . ⃗vn, ⃗w} is a set of n + 1

linearly independent vectors" why does a vector not sitting in a span automatically shows that the set of the spanning vectors plus that vector is linearly independent? I know it's intuitve and we canprove it, but which theorem fromtextbook shows this so that we don't have to prove it on our own?

## Response:
That's an excellent question, as it points to a foundational "building block" result in linear algebra.

The MAT223 textbook treats this concept as a key exercise for the student to prove rather than stating it as a citable theorem in the main text. You can find the exact statement you're looking for in **Chapter Exercise P3.8**:

> **P3.8** Let V be a vector subspace of Rⁿ of dimension 1 \< m \< n and suppose that B is a basis for V. Show that if v⃗ in Rⁿ is not an element of V, then the set B ∪ {v⃗} is linearly independent.

Since a basis `B` is a linearly independent set and `v` not being in `V` means `v` is not in `Span(B)`, this exercise is precisely the principle you're asking about.

Similarly, _Linear Algebra Done Right_ also presents this as a fundamental exercise:

> **Exercises 2A, #13** Suppose  $v_{1},...,v_{m}$  is linearly independent in V and  $w\in V.$  Show that  $v_{1},...,v_{m},w$  is linearly independent  $\Longleftrightarrow w\notin span\left(v_{1},...,v_{m}\right)$ .

Since this principle is presented as an exercise in both texts, you would typically be expected to provide a short proof if you use it, rather than citing a theorem number.

* * *

### The Proof

Here is the standard proof by contradiction, which you should be familiar with:

**To Prove:** If `{v₁, ..., vₙ}` is linearly independent and `w ∉ Span(v₁, ..., vₙ)`, then the new list `{v₁, ..., vₙ, w}` is also linearly independent.

1.  **Set up the defining equation:** To test for linear independence, we look for solutions to:  $a_{1}v_{1}+...+a_{n}v_{n}+bw=0$  Our goal is to show that the only solution is the trivial one (`a₁=...=aₙ=b=0`).
2.  **Assume the opposite for a contradiction:** Assume the set is linearly dependent. This means there is a solution where at least one scalar is not zero.
3.  **Consider the scalar `b`:**
    *   **Case 1: `b = 0`**. If `b=0`, the equation becomes `a₁v₁ + ... + aₙvₙ = 0`. Since `{v₁, ..., vₙ}` is linearly independent, this forces `a₁ = ... = aₙ = 0`. But this means all scalars are zero, which contradicts our assumption of a non-trivial solution.
    *   **Case 2: `b ≠ 0`**. If `b` is not zero, we can rearrange the equation:  $bw=-a_{1}v_{1}-...-a_{n}v_{n}$   $w=\left(-\frac{a_{1}}{b}\right)v_{1}+...+\left(-\frac{a_{n}}{b}\right)v_{n}$  This shows that `w` is a linear combination of `v₁, ..., vₙ`, which means `w ∈ Span(v₁, ..., vₙ)`. This contradicts our given information.

Both cases lead to a contradiction, so our assumption that the new set was linearly dependent must be false. Therefore, the set `{v₁, ..., vₙ, w}` is **linearly independent**.

## Prompt:
well thats prpbalmatic because 1. P3.3 comes befroe P3.8 2.in P3.3 the set spans the sopace is what we are trying to prove so we cant use that

## Response:
You are absolutely correct. That is an excellent and very sharp observation. You've identified a subtle but important issue in the structure of the MAT223 textbook's exercises.

Let's address your points directly:

### 1\. Chronological Problem (P3.3 vs. P3.8)

You are right; P3.3 comes before P3.8. Therefore, you cannot use the result of P3.8 to solve P3.3. The textbook's own solution to P3.3 (in Appendix C.3) makes the logical jump:

> "assume we have a vector w⃗ that is not in the span of ... A. Then the set A' = {v₁, ... vₙ, w⃗} is ... linearly independent."

This step is precisely what Exercise P3.8 asks you to prove later. This means that to solve P3.3 rigorously using only material presented up to that point, you would need to prove that intermediate step yourself.

### 2\. Justifying the Logical Leap

You are also right that this step needs justification. The logic does not assume that the set spans the space; rather, it uses the properties of linear independence to reach a contradiction.

Here is how you would formally prove that intermediate step, which you would need to do as part of solving P3.3.

**Sub-Proof:** Show that if `{v₁, ..., vₙ}` is linearly independent and `w ∉ Span(v₁, ..., vₙ)`, then `{v₁, ..., vₙ, w}` is also linearly independent.

*   **Setup:** Assume `{v₁, ..., vₙ}` is linearly independent and `w ∉ Span(v₁, ..., vₙ)`. To show the new set is linearly independent, we must prove that the only solution to the equation below is the trivial one (`a₁ = ... = aₙ = b = 0`). `a₁v₁ + ... + aₙvₙ + b w = 0`
*   **Proof by Contradiction:** Assume the set is linearly dependent, meaning a non-trivial solution exists. We examine the scalar `b`.
    *   **Case 1: `b = 0`**. The equation becomes `a₁v₁ + ... + aₙvₙ = 0`. Since `{v₁, ..., vₙ}` is linearly independent, all the `aᵢ` must be zero. This means all scalars are zero, which contradicts our assumption of a non-trivial solution.
    *   **Case 2: `b ≠ 0`**. We can rearrange the equation to `w = (-a₁/b)v₁ + ... + (-aₙ/b)vₙ`. This shows `w` is in the span of `{v₁, ..., vₙ}`, which contradicts our initial assumption that `w` is _not_ in the span.

Since both cases lead to a contradiction, our assumption was false. The set `{v₁, ..., vₙ, w}` must be linearly independent.

* * *

### Conclusion

You have correctly identified that the provided solution to P3.3 relies on a principle that is not formally proven until Exercise P3.8. To solve P3.3 rigorously, you must include the proof outlined above as part of your solution. This is a common situation in mathematics where fundamental "mini-proofs" are required to justify steps in a larger argument.

Consider my own version. Could it work?

## Response:
Yes, your proof is excellent. It is a completely valid and rigorous argument that correctly establishes the desired result.

Here is a breakdown of why your proof works so well:

*   **Correct Use of Lemma 3.3:** You correctly start by taking an arbitrary vector `w` from ℝⁿ and forming a set of `n+1` vectors. Citing Lemma 3.3 to conclude that this new set must be linearly dependent is the perfect first step.
*   **Crucial Contradiction:** Your argument to show that the coefficient `c_{n+1}` cannot be zero is the most important part of the proof, and you've handled it perfectly. By assuming `c_{n+1}` is zero, you correctly showed that this would contradict the given fact that `{v₁, ..., vₙ}` is linearly independent.
*   **Clear Conclusion:** By proving that `c_{n+1}` must be non-zero, you can validly rearrange the equation to show that any arbitrary vector `w` is a linear combination of `{v₁, ..., vₙ}`, proving that the set spans ℝⁿ.

Your proof is actually more explicit and rigorous than the one suggested in the solution key for the MAT223 textbook, as it avoids the logical jump that we discussed previously. This is a great example of a solid mathematical proof. Well done.

## Prompt:
repeat my proof

## Response:
Of course. Here is your proof transcribed.

* * *

### Proof that `n` Linearly Independent Vectors in ℝⁿ Form a Basis

Let `v₁, ..., vₙ` be `n` linearly independent vectors in ℝⁿ. To show this set is a basis for ℝⁿ, we must show that it also spans ℝⁿ.

Let `w` be an arbitrary vector in ℝⁿ. Consider the set `W = {v₁, ..., vₙ, w}`. This set contains `n+1` vectors. By

**Lemma 3.3**, any set of more than `n` vectors in ℝⁿ must be linearly dependent. Therefore, the set

`W` is linearly dependent.

Since `W` is linearly dependent, there exists a non-trivial solution (meaning not all scalars are zero) to the vector equation:

$$
c_{1}v_{1}+c_{2}v_{2}+\cdots +c_{n}v_{n}+c_{n+1}w=0
$$

Now, we will show that the scalar `c_{n+1}` cannot be zero. We assume for contradiction that `c_{n+1} = 0`. If `c_{n+1} = 0`, the equation simplifies to:

$$
c_{1}v_{1}+c_{2}v_{2}+\cdots +c_{n}v_{n}=0
$$

However, we are given that the set `{v₁, ..., vₙ}` is **linearly independent**. By definition, this means the only solution to the equation above is the trivial one, where `c₁ = c₂ = ... = cₙ = 0`.

If `c₁ = ... = cₙ = 0` and we assume `c_{n+1} = 0`, then all scalars are zero. This contradicts our finding that a non-trivial solution must exist. Therefore, our assumption must be false, and we can conclude that `c_{n+1} ≠ 0`.

Since `c_{n+1}` is not zero, we can rearrange the original vector equation to solve for `w`:

$$
w=\left(-\frac{c_{1}}{c_{n+1}}\right)v_{1}-\left(-\frac{c_{2}}{c_{n+1}}\right)v_{2}-\cdots -\left(-\frac{c_{n}}{c_{n+1}}\right)v_{n}
$$

This equation demonstrates that `w` is a linear combination of `v₁, ..., vₙ`, which means `w` is in `Span(v₁, ..., vₙ)`.

Because `w` was an arbitrary vector in ℝⁿ, we have shown that `ℝⁿ ⊆ Span(v₁, ..., vₙ)`. The reverse inclusion, `Span(v₁, ..., vₙ) ⊆ ℝⁿ`, is true by definition. Thus, `ℝⁿ = Span(v₁, ..., vₙ)`.

Since the set `{v₁, ..., vₙ}` is linearly independent and spans ℝⁿ, it is a basis for ℝⁿ.

## Prompt:
solution to 3.9 says Assume m \< n,

then there exists some vector vm+1 ∈ R

n such that ⃗vm+1 ∈/ V . but why? I know it's intuitve and we canprove it, but which theorem fromtextbook shows this so that we don't have to prove it on our own?

## Response:
That's the same fundamental question as before, applied in a slightly different context. The reasoning is based on a core theorem that connects the dimension of a subspace to its equality with the larger space.

The direct justification comes from **Theorem 2.39** in _Linear Algebra Done Right_.

### The Theorem and Justification

**Theorem 2.39** states:

> Suppose that V is a finite-dimensional vector space and U is a subspace of V such that `dim(U) = dim(V)`. Then `U = V`.

The logical implication you need is the **contrapositive** of this theorem, which is logically equivalent. The contrapositive states:

> If a subspace `U` is **not** equal to the entire space `V` (i.e., `U` is a proper subspace), then `dim(U) < dim(V)`.

To justify the step in Exercise P3.9, we can use the contrapositive of _that_ statement:

> **If `dim(U) < dim(V)`, then `U ≠ V`.**

### Applying it to Your Problem

1.  In your problem from Exercise P3.9, the subspace is `V` and the larger space is `ℝⁿ`.
2.  You are given that `dim(V) = m` and we know that `dim(ℝⁿ) = n`.
3.  The premise of the problem is that `m < n`, which means **`dim(V) < dim(ℝⁿ)`**.
4.  According to the theorem, since the dimension of the subspace `V` is strictly less than the dimension of the whole space `ℝⁿ`, the subspace cannot be equal to the whole space (`V ≠ ℝⁿ`).
5.  By the very definition of what it means for two sets to be unequal, if `V ≠ ℝⁿ`, there must exist at least one vector in `ℝⁿ` that is not in `V`. The solution simply names this vector `v_{m+1}`.

## Prompt:
so its not given in MAT223?

## Response:
Correct. The principle that "if a subspace `U` has a strictly smaller dimension than the space `V`, then `U` cannot be equal to `V`" is not stated as an explicit, numbered theorem in the MAT223 lecture notes.

The textbook uses this logic as a self-evident step in its proofs and exercises (like in P3.9), but for a formal, citable theorem, you would refer to a text like _Linear Algebra Done Right_ (specifically Theorem 2.39).

I wonder if my proof for 3.5 works as well. Instead of vhoosingbairbtiart vectors in V+W, I chose aritbairybvrcgorsninn V and W and impkivtly argue that their sum works as the WLOG vector for V+W. Is it rigorous enough by LADR 's standard

## Response:
Yes, your proof for P3.5 is logically correct and rigorous enough to meet the standards of a proof-based course like one using _Linear Algebra Done Right_.

Your strategy of choosing arbitrary vectors `v₁, v₂` from `V` and `w₁, w₂` from `W` to form two general elements `v₁ + w₁` and `v₂ + w₂` from `V+W` is completely sound. It correctly demonstrates that the closure properties hold for any elements in `V+W`.

* * *

### Analysis of Your Proof

*   **Non-empty / Additive Identity:** Correct. You show `0` is in `V+W`.
*   **Closure under Addition:** Your steps `(v₁ + w₁) + (v₂ + w₂) = (v₁ + v₂) + (w₁ + w₂)` and the conclusion that this is in `V+W` because `(v₁ + v₂) ∈ V` and `(w₁ + w₂) ∈ W` is exactly the right logic.
*   **Closure under Scalar Multiplication:** Your step `k(v₁ + w₁) = kv₁ + kw₁` and the conclusion that this is in `V+W` because `kv₁ ∈ V` and `kw₁ ∈ W` is also perfectly correct.

### Minor Stylistic Suggestion

For maximum clarity, and to follow a very common proof-writing convention you'd see in a text like LADR, you could make the setup slightly more explicit by starting with arbitrary elements _from the set `V+W`_. This is a stylistic improvement, not a correction of your logic.

A slightly more formal version would look like this:

**To Show: `V+W` is a subspace.**

1.  **Additive Identity:** Since V and W are subspaces, `0 ∈ V` and `0 ∈ W`. Therefore, `0 = 0 + 0 ∈ V+W`, so `V+W` is non-empty.
2.  **Closure under Addition:**
    *   Let `u₁` and `u₂` be arbitrary elements of `V+W`.
    *   By definition of `V+W`, there exist `v₁ ∈ V`, `w₁ ∈ W` such that `u₁ = v₁ + w₁`.
    *   Similarly, there exist `v₂ ∈ V`, `w₂ ∈ W` such that `u₂ = v₂ + w₂`.
    *   Consider the sum `u₁ + u₂`: `u₁ + u₂ = (v₁ + w₁) + (v₂ + w₂) = (v₁ + v₂) + (w₁ + w₂)`
    *   Since `V` and `W` are subspaces, `(v₁ + v₂) ∈ V` and `(w₁ + w₂) ∈ W`.
    *   Therefore, `u₁ + u₂` is a sum of a vector in `V` and a vector in `W`, so `u₁ + u₂ ∈ V+W`.
3.  **Closure under Scalar Multiplication:**
    *   Let `u ∈ V+W` and `k ∈ R`.
    *   By definition, there exist `v ∈ V` and `w ∈ W` such that `u = v + w`.
    *   Consider the product `ku`: `ku = k(v + w) = kv + kw`
    *   Since `V` and `W` are subspaces, `kv ∈ V` and `kw ∈ W`.
    *   Therefore, `ku` is a sum of a vector in `V` and a vector in `W`, so `ku ∈ V+W`.

Again, your proof is already correct. This alternative phrasing is just a common convention.
